This document provides instructions on how to add one or multiple new users to the system.

Note that you can add one user at a time.

Before you start, make sure that you have appropriate access permissions. If you cannot add users, please reach out to the Support team. To do that, send an email to support@test.com

This is now being tested for merge.
